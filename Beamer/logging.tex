	\begin{itemize}
	\item We use ELK(Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) Stack for this purpose.
	\item The application logs everything on a central location.
    \item Every microservice sends logs to a centralized location and logstash sends the logs to Elasticsearch.
    \item The logs can be visualized in Kibana.
    \item The ELK Stack has been deployed in the VM as well.
